## About the Workshop 

<img align=right width="30%" height="40%" src="https://i.makeagif.com/media/7-20-2017/tglPfl.gif" />

We are here with a workshop which aims at providing you an understanding of Clean Code via examples taken from various sources. This workshop will help you differentiate between "clean" and "dirty" code.

We will get our hands dirty by diving into some "dirty" code snippets and "cleaning" them with our learning. We will also see why some approaches are better than the others and try to develop a better understanding of all the principles of "Clean Code".

## Takeaways from this Workshop

* Better understanding on clean coding practices.
* Choose better approach when developing.
* Ability to differentiate between different approaches.
* Fun!
